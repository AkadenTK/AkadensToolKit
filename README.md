# Akaden' s Tool Kit for Windower v5

Tools to make the FFXI experience that much better.

## Superwarp
Use the many warp systems of Vana'diel via text-based commands. Some extra functional features include favorites, sending the same command to all local game clients, retrying a warp if it fails, and "fuzzy" search names. 

## Entity Frames
Displays target/subtarget/focus target HP/MP/TP bars in customizable positions as well as aggro'd target hp bars.
